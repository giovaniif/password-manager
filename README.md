<h2>🏷️ About</h2>
This project was created with the purpose of putting in practice some concepts I have learned in the past months about Sofware Tests and Architecture. Besides this, it can also be used as anyone's personal password management application.

<h2>🚀 Techs</h2>

This project was created using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript).

🔥 Databases

- Postgres (for the passwords and users recording)
- Redis (for rating limiter and [future] cache)
